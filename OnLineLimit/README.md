This version of the script has the objective of sending the log when the character limit is reached.

## Diferences

You don't need to create a log and a check file. Just put your Google authentication and set the key limit on line 15. Remember that each line represents a pressed key.

Simply set it to start with the system and it will send the log every time it reaches the limit.
